# Challenges

Here's a series of problems to practice perfecting your practical Python skills with the libraries you'll be using in the Momentum challenge.

## 1. Matrix Multiplication with Numpy

For the following problems, you'll be asked to perform the mathematical operations with Numpy. For each one, you'll probably find you need to read the Numpy documentation. I'll give you starter code.

### 1a

$$
y = f(x)
